To search just start typing a variant in the search box and it will auto complete. Variants are identified using <a href="http://varnomen.hgvs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HGVS nomenclature</a>, a standard created by the Human Genome Variation Society.  Most genetic test results are reported in HGVS nomenclature. This nomenclature describes a variant by indicating (1): a reference sequence, (2): what kind of sequence it is (genomic, coding DNA or protein), (3): the position of the variant in relation this reference sequence, and (4): the nucleotide or protein differences between the variant and the reference sequence.  For example, _NM_007294.3:c.5053A>G_ indicates a variant relative to reference sequence _NM_007294.3_, which is a coding DNA reference sequence (as indicated by _c_), that the variant is in position 5053, and that it involves changing an _A_ to a _G_.

# Understanding the data

#### Gene

The Gene column displays the name of the gene on which the variant was found,
as named by <a href="http://www.genenames.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HGNC</a>.  This will be either _BRCA1_ or 
_BRCA2_.


#### Genomic Nomeclature (GRCh38)

Coordinate of the variant on the GRCh38 reference genome. Click through to view the same coordinate on the UCSC Genome Browser.

#### HGVS Nucleotide

HGVS string that represents the variant at coding DNA nucleotide level

#### HGVS Protein

The predicted protein-level change (if any) that would be introduced by this variant.  HGVS notation indicates the position of the variant within the reference protein sequence (e.g. NP_009225.1 for BRCA1), and the change that would be introduced by this variant.  For example, _p.(Tyr15His)_ indicates a predicted change of _Tyr_ (Tyrosine) to _His_ (Histidine) at amino acid 15.  The notation _p.?_ indicates a variant for which one cannot predict the protein-level consequences.

#### Protein Abbrev

Shortened abbreviation of the HGVS Protein field using the one-letter abbreviation for an amino acid.

#### BIC Designation

Variant identifier in <a href="https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BIC</a> nomenclature.

### Clinical Significance 

The Clinical Significance column indicates whether expert curators, in this case the ENIGMA Consortium, have determined if the variant is pathogenic or benign.

##### _What do these classifications mean?_
- *Pathogenic variants* confer an increased risk of disease.
- *Likely pathogenic variants* have good evidence to support an association with disease risk.
- *Likely benign variants* have good evidence to support no association with disease risk.
- *Benign / Little Clinical Significance variants* are not associated with any markedly increased risk of disease.
- *Variants of uncertain significance (VUS)* are those for which the evidence of disease risk is not clear yet, sometimes because there is not yet enough evidence to classify them as either pathogenic or benign.

##### _My variant is classified pathogenic. What do I do now?_

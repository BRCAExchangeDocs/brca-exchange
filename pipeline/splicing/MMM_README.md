Hello,

My name is Melissa Meredith, I am a Molecular Biology major and undegraduate researcher from California State University, Monterey Bay. This is my first summer research experience and I hope to produce something that I can present at a conference in the fall. 

I am a Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Scholar working for Dr. Melissa Cline on the BRCA Exchange project. My project is identifying varaints of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that are located in exon sites that result in a truncated protein. I will update this README as I develop more of my project. 

Thank you for reading!
:)
